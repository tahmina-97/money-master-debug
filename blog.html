                    <strong>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage;</strong> the difference is that while data in
                    localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever
                    a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
                    assigned to that particular tab. <br>
                    <code>Local Storage:</code> This read-only interface property provides access to the Document’s
                    local storage
                    object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, except that
                    localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is
                    cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded
                    in a private browsing or incognito session). <br>
                    <code>Session Storage:</code> Session Storage objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage
                    read-only property.
                    A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are
                    valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the
                    browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new session is created
                    each time a tab or window is opened; this is different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is
                    opened with the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab, the sessionStorage
                    from the original tab is copied to the duplicated tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and
                    clears sessionStorage objects. <br>
                    <code>Both Storages have 4 methods:</code> setItem(), getIteam(), removeItem(), clear().

                    <strong>Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of any
                    function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means
                    that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state
                    can access that variable. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment. Any variables
                    assigned without an explicit scope (using the var, let, or const keywords) automatically become
                    global variables. <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Block scope is a sub-type of local scope.A block scoped variable means
                    that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible from outside the block. A block can
                    reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside the block even
                    if the block is inside a function. The block scope can be
                    defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be
                    of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these
                    variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                    How does the Event Loop works in JavaScript?

                    <strong>JavaScript has a runtime model based on
                        an event loop,</strong> which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing
                    events, and
                    executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and
                    Java. <br>
                    The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                    operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                    multi-threading. <br> The <code>call stack</code> is responsible for keeping track of all the
                    operations in line
                    to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack. <br>
                    The <code>event queue</code> is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing.
                    It follows the queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should
                    be sent for execution. <br>
                    Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                    browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded
                    operation.

                    An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack,
                    it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back
                    in for processing.

                    Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async
                    operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as
                    separate threads.

                    The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is
                    empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current
                    function call is processed.

                    <strong>An undefined variable or anything without a value will always return "undefined" in
                        JavaScript.</strong> This
                    is not the same as null, despite the fact that both imply an empty state.
                    It is a property of the global
                    object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is
                    the primitive
                    value undefined. It Can happen for many reasons. Some are given below: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When a variable is declared or initialized but no value is assigned to it, JavaScript
                            automatically displays "undefined".
                        </li>
                        <li>Also, when you try accessing values in, for example, an array or object that doesn’t exist,
                            it will throw undefined</li>
                        <li>Function which has no return</li>
                        <li>Parameter that is not passed will cause undefined</li>
                        <li>If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined</li>
                        <li>Accessing array elements outside the index range</li>
                        <li>Deleting an element inside an array</li>
                        <li>Set a value directly to undefined</li>
                    </ul>
